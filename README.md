# unit-4-game
_This game assigns random values to a set of 4 crystals, and gives the user a randomly generated goal number._
_Without going over the goal number, the user must click the crystals to both discover their values and hopefully reach the goal number._
_If the player reaches the exact goal number, they win!_
_Otherwise, if the player goes over the goal number, they lose._
